# DataScienceFinal_ChipSetAnalysys
analys the chip data set from https://chip-dataset.vercel.app/


# Requirements 
### A final-level project in this course should involve:
 - A clearly defined problem or question related to the dataset
    -  What is the colinearity of transistors and clockcycle
    -  predict vendor (producer) from chip performance
 - Data acquisition (e.g., scraping/API, or strong justification for choosing pre-cleaned open data)
    - hopefully we can get it from an api/web scrape
    - from the csv came from their download button, but
    if you look at the websites console, it includes
    all the data why? nobody knows
 - Cleaning and reshaping of the data (with code included)
    - clean to remove the nans, and tranform some things
 - Exploratory analysis and visualizations. (At least 4 visualizations)
  - Graph 
 - Use of at least two analysis techniques such as multiple regression or logistic regression. In
addition you should highlight the success of such models and briefly explain various iterations.
 - Communication of results using plots, tables in a well-organized report. The report should over
view the data, highlight abnormalities or trends, and summarize iterations of models. This
should be professionally done.
 - Final submission must also include a clean and organized file with reproducible code. Questions
will be asked regarding the code. Students should be able to explain what each part is doing.
