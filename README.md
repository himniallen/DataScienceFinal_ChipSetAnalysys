# DataScienceFinal_ChipSetAnalysys
analyze the chip data set from https://chip-dataset.vercel.app/


# Requirements 
### A final-level project in this course should involve:
- A clearly defined problem or question related to the dataset
   - When is the best time of day to drive to get the most tips?
   - Can we predict tip amount based on _____ certain other variables
   - What factors influence total fare? (to try and find out how to lower them?)
   - predict payment type based on trip characteristics?
- Data acquisition (e.g., scraping/API, or strong justification for choosing pre-cleaned open data)
   - hopefully we can get it from an api/web scrape
   - from the csv came from their download button, but
    if you look at the websites console, it includes
    all the data why? nobody knows
- Cleaning and reshaping of the data (with code included)
   - clean to remove the nans, and tranform some things
- Exploratory analysis and visualizations. (At least 4 visualizations)
   - Graphs that show  the correlations and how we can use those to predict what we want to predict.
- Use of at least two analysis techniques such as multiple regression or logistic regression. In
addition you should highlight the success of such models and briefly explain various iterations.
- Communication of results using plots, tables in a well-organized report. The report should over
view the data, highlight abnormalities or trends, and summarize iterations of models. This
should be professionally done.
 - Final submission must also include a clean and organized file with reproducible code. Questions
will be asked regarding the code. Students should be able to explain what each part is doing.
