# Taxi Driving Tips Analysis

# Requirements 
### A final-level project in this course should involve:
- A clearly defined problem or question related to the dataset
   - When is the best time of day to drive to get the most tips?
   - Can we predict tip amount based on time of day or other variables?
- Data acquisition (e.g., scraping/API, or strong justification for choosing pre-cleaned open data)
   - We get our data on Kagglehub. enocknkuya/tax-dropoff
- Cleaning and reshaping of the data (with code included)
   - We will remove nas, and we will create new columns with new data calculated from the existing data, such as the hour of day as discrete values, and the average tip amount for each hour.
- Exploratory analysis and visualizations. (At least 4 visualizations)
   1. Line chart that shows time of day vs average tip amount per ride.
   2. Bar chart for #1 to easily distinguish the hours of the day since we made those values discrete.
   3. Line chart showing the number of rides per hour.
- Use of at least two analysis techniques such as multiple regression or logistic regression. In
addition you should highlight the success of such models and briefly explain various iterations.
- Communication of results using plots, tables in a well-organized report. The report should over
view the data, highlight abnormalities or trends, and summarize iterations of models. This
should be professionally done.
 - Final submission must also include a clean and organized file with reproducible code. Questions
will be asked regarding the code. Students should be able to explain what each part is doing.
